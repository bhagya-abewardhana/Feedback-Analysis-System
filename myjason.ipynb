            "I have to admit I have not tri thi pedal with ani other guitar besid my strat but thi pedal give me everyth that I wantth best way that I can describ the sound of the ocd is qualiti and charactera a clean drivewhen you use thi pedal with less drive as a clean boost for your tube amp you will notic that it deliv a veri strong charact from your guitar and is veri sensit to your dynam while playinga an overdrivei have love the ibanez ts9 becaus it allow a strat to keep a vocal type of midrang while have sing trebl when you add drive to the ts9 it retain those characterist which is whi it is the industri standard for strat guitarist who want to keep their stratti charact and get the qualiti sound of a tube ampth reason whi the ocd is my prefer pedal over the ts9 is that it doe not let the low end distort as earli the ts9 allow you lower note to distort earlier and seem to then amplifi the signal the ocd give you the fattest low end with ton of tone If you like blue or hard rock you will notic that thi featur is exactli what you want to give your play a realli strong charact you gain bold and when your low end doe gain some crunch it is the biggest baddest tone that you could dream ofi use thi pedal with my hss strat and through a blue Jr iii and use the clean boost for the coolest clean tone ever It allow your play dynam to drive the amp not some arbitrari clip from your pedal when I am play heavier blue or rock stuff I just turn up the drive and have the boldest and highest qualiti sound that I have ever play withth hplp switchshift into HP is almost like a gain boost I have heard it describ as switch from an american fenderi sound LP to a british marshal sound HP I guess thi is a decent descript I have found that I get a thick ballsi sound in the LP and I dont lose ani qualiti in the HP It feel like you get a boost in your midrangeto conclud I would have to say that thi pedal is the perfect mix of ballsi overdr with qualiti tone If you have a qualiti amp and a qualiti guitar there is no reason to tri and save 30 by buy an ibanez ts9 or ts808 or ts9dx thi pedal will make you a lot happier than those will if you like to keep your low end intact and not allow it to break up too earli make it whimpi\n",

            "I love thi capo let me tell you about my capo journey where ive use everi brand while search for thi one first I alway own the old dunlop toggl action capo which is just old tech you know where it just a bundl of synthet cotton fiber the kind one use to use befor 1980 I had to go back to that when my first planet wave black thermoplast capo broke dont buy those if you live in a damp climat like CA each one I bought broke one broke within a week dure the winter raini day So I love those capo they were perfect but I wa done with the break so I figur Id tri other instead despit my love for the planet wave design I didnt know about the silver aluminum one yet well I hate each other one I tri kyser if you have had carpal andor are small hand you know what I mean you dont want a capo that involv squeez realli hard so that your hand are in pain and then you dont want to play the guitar I realli hate the kyser I know some folk love to squeez and use them that fine differ stroke right then I tri the schub you have to be kid me omg that thing is so ridicul it pop off it wiggl about it is tricki I hate it now I know mani folk are schub fan who give me a drive by downrat Im not say it isnt great for those who love it If you love the schub you love it uncondit and I respect that all Im say is that design is not for me and mani other folk like me there are other model that fail similarli to these 2 they make you squeez so hard it doe hurt for those like myself with sensit hand like the G7 I did fall in love with it until mayb the 5th squeez and then you have to hurt your hand by unsqueez it apart to put it back on awkward and pain sorri to be such a softi and a crybabi but if you have carpal you know what I mean you want to go easi on the hand and arm and not brutal them the other thing ive alway hate about the kyser and again it may be that my smaller physiqu is involv is how it get in the way so chord with a capo is a lot harder that just dumb kyser lover either accept that as a challeng or dont mind it or claim it doesnt do that but you know what Im talk about Ok so then becaus of all the broken planet wave thermoplast capo I turn next to dunlop turnscrew model I like them they are veri similar to the PW design but the screw locat is more awkward to use and turn their screw is a lot harder on the finger got the rip and pain fingertip to show for it So I turn back in search for a better planet wave model thi is it right here the silver one is excel and it made of aluminum not thermoplast I bought one and it ha last me almost 3 year now without a singl problem By now in contrast I would have run through 3 or 4 thermoplast one I want to say that if you are perform in a public venu never use the thermoplast one becaus my thermoplast one dramat burst and flew across the room and could easili poke someon eye out not kid dont use those in public situat back to the excel aluminum silver pwave capo I love it becaus it doesnt break not at all and ha all of the great thermoplast model featur that make it the best capo ever especi for us sensit folk with carpal or small hand peopl etc the great featur are1 eas of use and easi fit are perfect the best of all capo thi capo fit so easili simpli put it on the fretboard and the locat of the screw is perfect you never have to move the guitar or your hand more than a coupl inch unlik the other screwtop or all other capo there no need for ani move around adjust the guitar fall down due to balanc issu and then chase a fall guitar sheesh none of that nonsens you put it on and theyv engin it brilliantli so you can easili get it on move it from fret to fret put it where you want and screw it in with great eas wow best ever in thi categori eas of use is top ever2 It will never hurt you it onli help It weigh noth is easi to carri you can slip it onto the peg area it just is so light I still cant believ how light it feels3 It doe what it suppos to that other capo dont do No issu with be in tune just screw it in to the level of tight you desir no wrestl around like some capo do the screw is in the most easi locat and the screw itself is nice made so it doesnt hurt your finger at all when you screw and unscrew it a breez No problem with the size it so small it doesnt get in your way on the fretboard you wont have to do hand yoga in order to play capod song it is flat I know what a concept A capo should alway be flat and out of your way so you can play chord not pretzel twister instead of chord now I play capod song all the time becaus of thi capo and it is so much fun music a whole new magic experi the truth ive found is that good equip matter in music make I never play acoust guitar as well or as much until I got my first applaus guitar with great action I have a yamaha I love now sinc the applaus neck break but both guitar taught me that you have to have good equip that easi to use in the case of guitar great action is imper In the case of capo eas of use and no pain produc is imper and it open up the world of capo use the magic of the mathemat of music theoryif you love the other brand dont diss me I know it perfect for you and Im happi for you that it work perfectli for you becaus when you have the best one for you you will shine with your music and I will enjoy listen to you play but those of you who have sensit or small hand or have carpal know what Im talk about you wont settl for the tortur of kyser and schub gotta be kid me I bought everi capo imagin need to have a garag sale to get rid of the pile but end up that I wa use the old toggl type again instead until I found the aluminum silver planet wave capo planet wave ha made the perfect capo now no more issu just easi fun play capod song again onli buy the silver model becaus whenif

sound I wa abl to match exactli an authent origin univib sound with some adjust It seem to kind of muffl the pick attack or compress it also I have a loveh relationship with thi pedal after about a week of test it some day I hate itbut I like the build qualiti and the speed control I origin like that it wa one of onli two pedal that didnt strip the trebl off my tone until I realiz the mid were boost the bass wa cut and the pick attack wa somehow tweak mix bag and at 200 shouldnt be mxrdunlop m68 new in 2014 At about 140 the new m68 univib is a veri good vibe pedal with much to like It is second place on my list On pure sound I might even like it slightli better than the jimi and that say someth it the perfect form factor shapes with no signific color of the tone other than perhap a tini boost of trebl in one mode the m68 give the jimi a good runand if you are extrem tight on board space it might be a better choic for you they sound veri similar the m68 ha a wider rang of adjust on speeddepth than the jimi but Im not sure the extra rang is use mxrjim dunlopmxr have great factori custom servic if you ever have an issu they fix one of my pedal free even though out of warranti I realli do wish mxr would move their power suppli jack to the rear vertic surfac instead of the right side vertic surfac It is often in the way of right angl plug on all my other mxr use of the small top left push button for switch from choru to vibe on thi pedal wa the main neg issu as Id have to leav it with the mini switch engag and the red led burn all the time look like it is on when I wa not actual engag the circuit with the main switch It wa also a tight fit thi pedal ha a level knob which Im usual a fan of but I dont see the need for it on thi effect I didnt care for the white main led much and of cours the power suppli locat the led on thi doe puls the speed but wa annoy due to the white led that a subject thing I suppos all said thi is a great sound option with that perfect mxr size so a good choic but still 2X the cost of the jimi I stuck with the jimi on form function sound and valu dunlop univib uv1 cool stainless steel construct knob were hard to see set placement of vintag switch on the back of the pedal wa easili forgotten at worst and awkward at best non standard 18v power suppli take doubl slot from my power suppli brick sound wa veri good but did also color my EQ sound by boost the bass and muffl the mid and high slightli On the one hand thi sound match a lot of record univib sound ive heard On the other hand onc you strip the trebl it hard to put it back in the mix the seller had a 3 day return polici 3 day so I return it and they lost the sale othewis I would still be think about thi one I wa on the fenc about whether it wa my winner I wa abl to match a true univib sampl but the trebl wa slightli lack and bug me At 220 Id have to love it to keep it voodoo lab micro vibe like the form factor the simpl control high visibl knob abil to toe tweak control standard 9V power suppli and placement of all jack can get a veri lush even excess univib sound except the bass is veri boost and midshigh are cut the EQ effect just kill the pedal for me it go back not my pick at 150 bbe soul bender My least favorit vibe It had extrem muffl of mid and high heavi boost of bass In a band mix Im pretti sure it would get total lost At home might sound ok form factor wa good control were simpl I think it puls the speed My recollect is it had an overli bright blue led It wa the first vibe I bought and I onli compar to fullton and dunlop befor return it had some useabl sound but with the intens abov 50 had an annoy womp womp womp of a bass note that wa not come from my guitar a weird defect in the effect sound in my opinion with intens below 50 it wa usablekind of but a tone muffler I return thi one earli dunlop rotovib A good choic perhap the onli choic if you must have express pedal control speed adjust didnt color the tone much and that wa a problem on most other univib test limit speed rang and awkward control placement were most annoy to me intens rang seem less than other pedal too larg footprint if mount on board but also offer the abil to take NO space on the board by not mount it I didnt like that when you switch the effect on you are automat at high speed due to the mechan natur of the design some awkward in the placement of control and power plug vs guitar cabl when plug in std power suppli a plu led indic good and flash the speed durabl construct although the mechan natur mean in time someth will need lubric and you may need to replac intern gear or pot overpr 15 to 2X in my opinion other gener modul effect univib are effect a phase effect without the swooshi spaceag edg on the sound you can probabl modifi a modern phaser pedal to get the univib sound which is like a vibrato plu analog choru combin A modern phaser is close a modern flanger is much too spaceag sound vibrato pedal can captur the vibrato aspect of a univib and Id recommend the behring vibrato at 25 if you like vibrato sound univib are normal use for their choru set not the vibrato set didnt care for the behring time machinemi gear use for test

for the love of it and I feel that way about music sofirst the model ive test are far and away more realist to my ear than other model ive use which includ logic studio amp these sound almost as good btw pod x3live and xtpro the HD model are notic better and the fizz is gone gone gone the origin pod and 20 which sound the same to me and made me happi at the time and the tonelab SE which I miss for a while but not anymorei made a few patch for one of my guitar base on have a bassman 4x10 alongsid the Dr Z and it is the coolest sound ive ever made with thi guitar easili better sound to my ear than the real amp ive been use mayb becaus I put them off stage and dont run them veri loud I ador the sound of thi unitoh and as alway forget about all the preset theyr probabl all as useless as you imagin they might benow the bad news and it signific for somefirst off edit is clunki like it wa on the XT and x3live just forget about tri to use the display connect to a comput serious when you start from an init patch you onli get lucki it seem to manag to coax it into two amp confignext the function of thi unit is exagger by it spec you will almost certainli not be abl to do 8 FX at onc the way your think whi let say you use an XT or a X3 think about what your use toyou start with 8 fxsubtract effect bank for1 volum pedal you need to use an effect bank you might be abl to use an analog pedal but I like my volum after my compressor so I have to do it in the loop I guess2 FX loop onli work with an effect bank line6 is there ani way you can make thi alway activ in a firmwar upgrad seem like you could3 nois gate use to be alway avail dont worri if you mix thi with the m13 as I plan to do though as the m13 ha a great gate I mostli use clean or just bare brokenup amp so I might be abl to skip this4 wah thi is alway avail and activ in the X3 and below5 posteq the x3live had a final EQ befor final output that I like a lot in addit to all the other FX too you need to dedic an FX bank nowso you might onli have 3fx left for me put in a clean boost and tube drive which I think sound better in thi box than they did in the m13 probabl becaus theyr digit part of the signal is all I can think and a verb for the amp No slot left what if you need delay and modul eek I have to rethink the way I use FX in thi box still evalu how that will work for mewhat if your a guy like me who wa use the x3live occasion as a onebox solut for a dualvoic guitar all my guitar have piezo bridg No dicei will have to use an acoust preamp No matter I have one I will probabl dedic a null amp to bring thi signal into the unit and mix itin addit there arent as mani computerrecord rout option as the x3live and the supersweet abil to switch between two FX chain in one patch instead of switch program is gone As far back as my old vox tonelab SE I could liter switch channel from one ampcab to anoth in the same FX chain you could do someth similar on the x3live not here also line 6 whi on earth cant you make the midi in and out work as a usb midi interfac with thi unit how complic can that realli bein short the x3live ha significantli significantli more flexibl imho than thi unit for mani of us at least and ought not to have been discontinu imho for some of you it still a viabl optiony also still might need your other fxi thought it might be possibl that thi unit even if I need to use my AG stomp for my acoust side again which Im happi to do would bump my m13 off the stage It did not at first but after a while I did inde get rid of the m13 and dont miss it that said I think from what Im hear that some of the FX especi the dirt pedal work far better insid thi box than they do in the m13 when you connect it to a pod or ampmi favorit patch so far that ive made which use the bassman model and the unbeliev Dr Z model far and away my favorit amp model evah dont leav ani room for modul or other special FX Im not a switch whole patch on the fli guy I turn FX off and on but after a bit of tweak and patchmak I discov that for my sound I didnt need dual amp chain that often so I have all my flexibl backso am I complain about these limit No becaus the sound of thi unit is so extraordinari Id take off a full star for thi shortcom but the fact is the unit sound good enough that I cant do itther will at some point I hope be a nextgener of thi technolog which will possibl address some of the usabl shortcom but I have to say for thi price I am total satisfi with the soundin the meantim am I will to trade the flexibl of my former rig for the sound of thi one heck ye it sound that good I even love the model of amp I know ill never use for the first time ever and after a few month of experi I wa abl to make patch that complet work for my twovoic guitar stuff with NO addit outboard gear if I didnt want So ive simplifi to where I want to and no longer feel like Im realli compromis anythingso start with a rig consist of the hd500 and sometim an m13 and an acoust preamp current a yamaha agstomp mix in with the HD signal through the aux input ive now gotten to the point where I can do everyth I want if I need without the addit pedal and I sold the m13 I kept a few analog pedal and such that I just like but rare take them out of the hous anymoreim onli nitpick so that you will know all the tradeoff for what I have been fantas about basic an m13 in form and function with a hand of amp model shove in the box thi is as close as were probabl go to come and did I mention the sound it serious greatupd I have learn that I will inde have no problem replac my m13 as well and sold it off I thought Id miss it but I dontupd As of februari 2012 I have supplement thi product with a black jame tyler variax jtv59 korean and it a marriag made in heaven

so you dont have to use behring driver it plugandplayi have some good thing to say about the focusrit scarlett 2i2 all about the hardwar and some bad thing all about the softwar ive tri use the driver version 21 which came with the disk and the udpat 22 which I download from focusrit websiteto let you know what I need in an interface1 balanc stereo inout2 high qualiti headphon amp3 volum knob for headphon amp and for the main line4 good digitaltoanalog conversion5 low output latenc input latenc not import to mei dont use the mic preamp which is one of the big sell point of thi devic the good thi box is simpl and welldesign It doe what you want ha veri conveni control and ha high build qualiti Im pleas with the digitaltoanalog convers It ha a great big volum knob and anoth for the headphon amp It ha switch so each input can be a linein or microphon preamp It ha a switch for zerolat monitor of whatev is come in the headphon amp wa of particular concern for me I use headphon a lot and a poor headphon amp can be quit a problem the behring headphon amp wa onli ok specif it ha an output imped of 50 ohm the rule of thumb for good headphoneamp match is that the output imped should be 18 the imped of the headphonesmi hd 595 have 50 ohm of imped break thi rule you get distort of the frequenc respons In my case mostli thi meant attenu of the bass most manufactur dont list their output imped possibl becaus they are embarrass anyway focusrit doe which is one reason I trust them a littl more the output imped is less than 10 ohmsrespect but not amaz still not as low as I would need in principl but I can notic an improv in the bass respons in my headphon there plenti of extra voltag here too so I could drive higher imped can if necessari anyway good headphon amp check balanc in and out work veri well the in accommod a 14 tr style in and xlr the light around them show when someth actual come in and shine red when it in danger of clip there lot of gain avail I have them turn all the way down almost the out are tr style balanc or unbalanc and are locat on the back I like the look of the box with a red metal case and the front and back are sturdi and attract as well the usb cabl is just a type B port thi mean you can replac it if it get damag or whatev the behring for exampl wa hardwir to it cablek of annoy it buspow I actual would have been fine with a wallwart but thi is even more simplei realli have no complaint whatsoev about the hardwar the bad the driver for thi thing is horribl under window XP I have a clean instal with noth instal except my daw softwar acrobat reader and thi driver I mean my comput is realli strip down perform use the behring wa good the latenc time between play a note and hear it out the speaker wa 8 ms use the behring which isnt realli perceptibleunfortun the focusrit driver though it technic asio appar doesnt have anyth like an accept latenc the lowest latenc I could set it at and get sound out instead of crackl and pop wa 23 ms At that level the instrument begin to sound veri sluggish and laggi it veri difficult at least for me to work with a larg latenc like thati wa readi to return thi devic when I decid as a last ditch effort to instal asio4al that sort of an asio driver to use if you absolut cannot make the manufactur driver perform at a decent level I instal it and it work the output latenc wa a tini 43 ms onli 3 of which are actual output latenc so thi is realli impress I conclud that the hardwar is veri veri good in thi machin but the softwar is horribleunfortun you cant actual uninstal the focusrit driver becaus otherwis window doesnt recogn the devic and it never even turn onit not class compliant unlik the behring So now I have two driver for it instal onli one of which I useth bad news is that thi configur is veri buggi In gener when I just turn the comput on and tri and play my vst instrument all I get is crackl and pop until I open the asio configur panel and increas the buffer the funni thing is that it doesnt matter where the buffer start out I alway have to increas it befor I get ani good sound out I can start it out with a huge bufferlot of latencyand it will crackl until I open it and increas the buffer yet more I have to do thi everi time I turn on the comput also sometim if I leav it on for a while and come back it will be crackli again until I increas it yet anoth step We are talk about major bug herei decid to tri ditch asio4al and tri to make the focusrit driver work againmayb there wa a set I wa miss As I wa tri to set the buffer size I heard the sound of an explos and then my comput reboot when it came back I couldnt get good sound out even when I turn the buffer way up tri reboot a few more time still didnt work So I uninstal and reinstal the focusrit softwar At first it didnt work I had to instal asio4al as well and now I can sort of get sound out of it half the timei hope you are get the idea these driver are terribl aw A monkey could have written a better driver I would give it 1 star if it wasnt for the fact that the devic work veri veri well when all the star align and the driver recogn the drive and allow it to play I guess Im will to sacrific conveni and stabil for nice hardwar when it work I would never use thi in a live situat or when time is criticalth good thing about driver is that they can updat and fix them Im hope for that they have alreadi revis the driver onc which is amaz becaus even the 22 driver is serious an abomin just like the 21 close thought unfortun there realli isnt a usb interfac that ha a good driver the behring driver alway work but if you move the interfac from one usb port to the other it wa no longer recogn and you had to reinstal the driver howev you didnt have to use the behring driver and asio4al would give you 11 ms and perform without ani complic that about as troubl free as ive seen in thi type of deviceif you read about the presonu audiobox usb and the maudio fast track pro probabl the two closest competitor to thi focusrit what you get is a bunch of comment just like thi onehorr horribl driver that never get fix actual macki make a competitor as well the onyx blackjackbut the review of that show that the driver is possibl even wors than thi one unfortun none of the pro music manufactur care about their driver so we have to live with unstabl system that onli work half the time mayb it better under mac I dont knowinterestingli thi is realli the onli usb 20 devic in thi rang that quit shock consid how long the usb 20 standard ha been around the onli real implic of thi is that the usb 11 devic like the maudio and presonu can onli do two channel 2496 audio in OR out not both at the same time there not enough throughput in usb 11so in light of the competit the focusrit look kind of ok unfortun all audio interfac manufacturersat least in thi rang of devicethink there no need for good hardwar and especi good softwar At least the hardwar in thi one is up to spec We can cross our finger for improv driver in the futurebottom line thi is a fantast 5star deviceif you can make the softwar work consistentlyif you are on a tight budget or dont care about balanc inout Id recommend you go with the behring uca202 or ufo2020 they are ton cheaper class complaint and have better driver If you use a high imped headphon with it even the headphon amp is pretti good on that one updat may 2012 A new version of the driver 23 came out sinc the write of the abov the new driver actual work I have stop use asio4al and I get decent latenc onc in a whilenot too oftenit will inexplic requir me to edit the set and increas the buffer and some percentag of the time when I do that it will reboot my comput If I dont chang anyth most of the time it work ok I would never use thi

            "I have been play guitar for longer than I care to admit back in 1966 I went into the music store with my dad and cherri pick the finest fender telecast in the whole store back then they were all handmad so there were variat and by spend some time would yield you an incred find So I am not a newbi to play or work on guitar I didnt use thi capo on my 66 becaus I have it apart in order to make exact vintag reproduct of the bodytoday modern guitar use medium jumbo fret My 66 had thin fret with the medium jumbo fret they are suffici high that if you check them onc fret a note with someth as accur as the snark SN 2 all instrument clip on chromat tuner you will see that the note move up one or two bar on the tuner onc you fret it that is one or two bar abov the note you are then fret So I must admit my quest for the perfect capo would enabl me to adjust it so that the guitar doesnt go out of tune when use a capoi compar the G7 perform capo the six string silver with the schubb S1 stainless steel guitar capo for steel string guitar and thi planet wave nstriaction capo although the G7 wa substanti built and look rather impress I found it to be too bulki so it kept get in the way while tri to play chord So I sent it back So now it come down to the shubb 1 delux and the planet wave I went back and forth with these two tuner a whole lot of time I would perfectli tune the guitar with the snark and then appli the capo I tri to discern the differ between which one of these would make the guitar go out of tune more than the other I final conclud that there wa no differenceth schubb S1 had the abil to be adjust so fine that it would bare be hold on to the neck If you set that one at it gentlest set you could get it to be almost perfectli in tune even with the capo on but set it that softli and it would just about fall off the guitar So that is the last thing that you want to happen in the middl of a perform the planet wave capo in contrast even at the lightest set wa still a solid grip on the neck I also notic that the planet wave had a wider spread across the string and therefor wa less critic of the posit in order to get it rightth schubb S1 is a wellmad product it ha nice finish metal compon but with it roller ball system of fasten when you loosen it for sure your go to occasion be drop it in on the floor you could say that requir two hand in order to remov it the planet wave on the other hand is a true onehand tool that make it easi to remov and to put back on I tri both of these on one of my other fender telecast as well as on one of my acoust I got the same tune result on all of them I am veri critic and exact so when I say that the tune result would chang when you put on the capo you must understand that the tuner wa onli move one line most peopl wouldnt even bother with that much of an adjust but I know that there is noth to compar to a guitar with good string on it and to hear the tone and the blend of those string in perfect tune perfect harmoni rule you know that feel when you come to the end of a great song and you hit your last note and finish with a full chord that is perfectli in tune there is noth to compar to itth planet wave is a littl bit bulkier and if I had to get critic of it I would say it doe get in the way a tini bit more than the schubb S1 although thi factor is not such a great differ as to preclud me choos one over the other the way each of them mount and dismount to the guitar doe make me lean more strongli to the planet wavesi saw other review that comment that one type of capo provid a better tone than anoth type of capo tri as I might I could not reproduc the differ that they spoke of there are so mani factor affect the tone such as after chang the capo wa a guitar bodi lean a littl bit more one way then it wa the last time for exampl wa the face of the guitar a littl closer to the ear rang as compar to the last capo you test that mightv been project more from the side of the guitar I also felt that onc the capo squeez the string down the onli thing that is creat tone is the fret line between it and the bridg So at least between these two I found no total differencesi want to say that if you are use medium size jumbo fret and high action you are realli bend the string in order to fret it therebi chang the pitch I love low action with no buzz on lighter gaug string Id rather danc across the top like a ballet dancer then scrub heavi gaug string To each hi own they say I just consid it import to let you know that Im conduct thi experi with 8 gaug string on the tele electr and 9 gaug on the acoust So if your run a much heavier gaug string with lower action you would of cours have less tune shift go on becaus you could adjust the capo and both of these have a round adjust knob for finetun and be abl to adjust it to the point where you are press just beyond the level of the fret and not realli squeez it all the way down on the fret board and therefor have less of a challeng in tri to keep it in tune while use a capo although I doubt mani are set it that way but rather squeez it down to the fret board instead although it is possibl with heavi gaug string that you can fine tune the pressur suffici that it will yield a tune instrument while under the load of the heavier gaug string creat a strong enough grip at thi finer set so it wont slide off of the guitar like the shubb doe at it lighter settingof cours all thi is predic upon you not retun the guitar when you chang the capo posit that realli is the onli way to creat a perfectli tune instrument and that is to do a littl tweak when you chang the capo posit Im sure most peopl ignor that and consid the ever so slightli out of tune instrument is someth that is not objection and doesnt imped the overal qualiti of their perform I find on the other hand that a guitar which is perfectli in tune take the music to a level that is not possibl no matter how littl or much it is out of tuneso I conclus I find the planet wave easiertous and with it longer arm capabl of a wider fret board while at the same time capabl of the thinner fret board as well as be the one that I highli recommend notwithstand the shubb place a veri close second and with it slightli smaller size it doe in fact get in the way a littl less than the planet wave all in all they both are the best of all the one ive tri\n",

jack along the back edg of both unit is an acquir tast Im not bother by it becaus I have space to run the cabl but it worth consid your physic layout and whether that work for youth led screen appear to be ident in size on both unit and that lead me to my main workflow issuesth flat posit of the screen make use the unit on a flat surfac less comfort than it should be especi sinc the menu is use so much A slant or adjust screen mount would probabl be ask for design troubl I do woodwork and made myself a simpl stand that slant at 25 degre and doesnt interfer with jack access it make a tremend differ on my neck and upper back while read the screen and for gener use tascam should consid a similar accessoryth softwar is larg the same for both unit asid from addit master tool essenti packag preset and here lie my major critic I feel a real conflict between directli access function ie level EQ arm track with dedic knob and button and be forc to indirectli access other function use what I see is an inflex constrain menu systemif there were some way to custom the menu navig the equival of softwar hotkey it possibl the frequent repetit of nonfunct step such as press the home button and select with the wheel would not wear on me as much as they doth best evid of an unbalanc design I see is the dedic phantom power button on both unit whose purpos is to display the phantom screen where you then make a select to turn the power on and off that crystal for me the hybrid charact and compromis made here between softwarebas record and use a dedic hardwar recorderwhen space for knob and button is sever limit I can understand the design think and tradeoff that drive have so much function access through the menu but the dp008ex is stuf with knob and button and even my first multitrack a fostex x15 effect doubledup the function of two track to cover four So I have to question whether the tradeoff tascam made here in fact diminish the user experiencewith connect and softwarebas record use even smaller devic rapidli improv I believ the market for dedic hardwar record such as the dp008ex will be larg made up of peopl like me who grew up with older record and are look to recaptur some of that experi I think tascam would be wellserv take that into account alway like the design of tascam gear it just look and feel wellmad and that still in larg part true of the dp008ex

            "I have been play guitar for more year than I care to admit okay I bought a 1966 telecast brand new back then still have it and love it I have a lot of differ guitar mostli electr and 4 acoust On my electr I love extra light 8 gaug string onli about 5 of us do I can fli on those and do thing at a pace thi is a lot more difficult with heavier gaug string anyhow I digress but for a reason light gaug string are subject to tune problem if you have big fat fret like the 05034 found on gibon and espltd when you squeez the string to fret it with light gaug string it is all too easi to squeez it all the way to the fret board with xlarg jumbo fret that can be quit a distanc make the guitar go out of tune the cure for that is use heavier gaug string such as 10 or more so it make it possibl to determin quit easili just where the top of the fret is without do the full squeez all the way to the fret board So most capo work with 10 and on up becaus there is a lot more tension on the string So a lot of capo can creat a comfort fit fulli fret the string without them go into the sharp note zoneso sinc I use lighter gaug string and even 9s are subject to the same limit I have had a hard time find a capo that would sit comfort at the top of the rang between the fret and the board and still squeez the string suffici so as to not creat ani buzz and do so without make the string too sharp guess what now I found it I have sever capo and none of them make the grade for light gaug string except thi one To be honest with you I wa surpris when it workedokay so here is how I put it to the test I use the snark headstock tuner which is a great littl tuner if you know the secret to use it I also have the peterson HD tuner bench model which is fodder for anoth post with it one tenth of one cent tune accuraci okay back to the explanationwith the snark you tune the open string until the line stay in the center without waver off to one side the onli problem is that most ani headstock tuner I have seen they arent superbl accur the peterson headstock tuner I sent back becaus it wa act crazi anyhow So the secret to use the snark which I like best out of the headstock tuner I have tri is to tune the open string first and then fret the string on let say the 5th fret you will occasion find that a string in the open posit regist as be in tune even though it may be a littl sharp or a littl flat so when you strum the whole chord you will get a desir to tune it so your ear can hear it in order to get it spot on there is noth more beauti than a perfectli tune guitar and noth wors than one that is well out of tuneso by tune the open string and then tune the fret string onc both are in tune it is right on So in the open posit if by chanc it is a tini bit sharp not enough to regist on the tuner when you fret that string for exampl on the 5th fret that natur stretch the string a littl bit make it sharper which will now show on the snark as a note that is too sharp onc you balanc the open string and the fret string you realli have a wonder tune instrument you dont even need to hear it So your audienc is not listen to you tune up yet you get it right in the sweet spot that we all love and know so wellso with that be said you can more fulli understand whi thi daddario NS artist capo is the cat8217 meow It is the first tuner that I ever use that kept the guitar perfectli in tune after clamp it on the neck It is adjust like the other are but thi one is sensit for light gaug string as wellyou often see artist trim up their tune after put on the capo not with thi one even with light gaug string I must admit I wa surpris take it right out of the wrapper after go through the abov tune procedur to get the guitar spot on that it immedi did the job just right It wasnt even a littl bit sharpto be super critic here is anoth tip when use thi capo put it closer to the fret rather than in the middl between two fret for some reason it stretch the string less in do so It ha to do with the tension resist at a steeper angl right alongsid of a fret rather than farther way like in the middl between the two fret I did get a tini bit of sharp when posit between the two fret with 8 gaug stringssinc the two most import factor are that it is comfort to use not get in the way when play open chord and keep the guitar in tune the best way to use thi capo is to simpli clamp the string right abov the second fret for exampl rather than right below the third one right below the third one give you that perfect tune also just like right abov the second one doe but it keep the capo way out of your way As a matter of fact I am so accustom to use the capo posit to know where to finger the chord that I sometim make a mistak and fret them one lower than they belong with a littl practic or not even look at the guitar instantli correct that To say thi quit simpli is to say use thi capo farther away from your hand you just slide it down to be right abov the fret below it rather than right below the fret abov itso there it is thi capo doe the job perfectli and is light and easi to clamp Of cours if it can accur handl 8s it will breez through anyth thicker out of the box it is set at it lightest set and that is perfect for 8s on the telecast I tri it on tele and strat realli have the same neck just with differ head stock So it will work the same with bothso I guess I cant recommend thi capo high enough sinc it is the onli one that work perfectli with super light gaug string My onli problem is be sure to rememb which guitar case it is in so I can switch it over when use a differ guitar I might get anoth one for a backup\n",
